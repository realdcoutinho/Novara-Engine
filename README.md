# Novara Engine 🚀  

Novara Engine is a **DirectX-based** game engine built from the ground up, inspired by the Overlord Engine from the Graphics Programming 2 course. The goal of this project is to **modernize and fully recreate** the engine while implementing best practices and up-to-date technologies.

## 🎯 **Project Goals**
- Recreate the core functionality of the a 3D game Engine
- Implement **modern rendering techniques** using DirectX
- Ensure a **modular and scalable** architecture
- Keep the engine **optimized and extensible** for future use

## ⚙️ **Current Features**
- Basic project structure & setup
- DirectX-based rendering pipeline (WIP)
- Modular folder structure for scalability

## 📌 **Planned Features**
- Advanced rendering techniques (PBR, shadows, post-processing)
- Physics & collision system
- Audio integration
- Playable Game

## 🛠️ **Building & Running**
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/realdcoutinho/NovaraEngine.git
2. Open `NovaraEngine.sln` in **Visual Studio 2022**.
3. Build the solution in **Debug x64**.
4. Run the engine!

## 🔥 **Contributing**
This is an ongoing personal project, but contributions, feedback, and suggestions are welcome!
