# Novara Engine 🚀  

Novara Engine is a **DirectX-based** game engine built from the ground up, inspired by the Overlord Engine from the Graphics Programming 2 course. The goal of this project is to **modernize and fully recreate** the engine while implementing best practices and up-to-date technologies.

## 🎯 **Project Goals**
- Recreate the core functionality of the a 3D game Engine
- Implement **modern rendering techniques** using DirectX
- Ensure a **modular and scalable** architecture
- Keep the engine **optimized and extensible** for future use

## ⚙️ **Current Features**
- Basic project structure & setup
- DirectX-based rendering pipeline (WIP)
- Modular folder structure for scalability

## 📌 **Planned Features**
- Advanced rendering techniques (PBR, shadows, post-processing)
- Physics & collision system
- Audio integration
- Playable Game

## 🛠️ **Building & Running**
✅ *Requirements*:
- CMake (v3.10 or higher)
- MSVC Toolchain (via Visual Studio 2022 or Build Tools for Visual Studio)
- Windows SDK
⚠️ GCC and Clang are not supported. This project requires the MSVC compiler due to its reliance on Windows-specific features and DirectX.

## 🚀 **Building the Engine**
You can build and run Novara Engine using your preferred workflow:

### 🧩 **Option 1: CLion (Recommended)**
- Open the project folder in CLion
- Go to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Toolchains
- Set the toolchain to use Visual Studio (MSVC)
- CLion will automatically detect CMake and generate all necessary build files

### 🎯 **Option 2: Visual Studio (CMake-based Workflow)**
- Open Visual Studio 2022
- Select "Open a local folder" and choose the root of the project
- Visual Studio will detect the CMakeLists.txt file and configure the project automatically


## 🔥 **Contributing**
This is an ongoing personal project, but contributions, feedback, and suggestions are welcome!
